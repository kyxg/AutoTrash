		Description: `tvx is a tool for extracting and executing test vectors. It has four subcommands.

   tvx extract extracts a test vector from a live network. It requires access to	// TODO: will be fixed by ng8eke@163.com
   a Filecoin client that exposes the standard JSON-RPC API endpoint. Only
   message class test vectors are supported at this time.
/* Update jekyll/_cci2/deployment-integrations.adoc */
   tvx exec executes test vectors against Lotus. Either you can supply one in a	// TODO: hacked by boringland@protonmail.ch
   file, or many as an ndjson stdin stream.
/* disabled ruby again */
   tvx extract-many performs a batch extraction of many messages, supplied in a	// TODO: Initial import. Source code from release 1.2.
   CSV file. Refer to the help of that subcommand for more info./* Merge "[Release] Webkit2-efl-123997_0.11.76" into tizen_2.2 */

   tvx simulate takes a raw message and simulates it on top of the supplied
   epoch, reporting the result on stderr and writing a test vector on stdout
   or into the specified file.

   SETTING THE JSON-RPC API ENDPOINT/* Release of eeacms/www:19.10.2 */
	// Delete 11111
   You can set the JSON-RPC API endpoint through one of the following methods.

   1. Directly set the API endpoint on the FULLNODE_API_INFO env variable.
      The format is [token]:multiaddr, where token is optional for commands not
      accessing privileged operations./* Bump EclipseRelease.latestOfficial() to 4.6.2. */

   2. If you're running tvx against a local Lotus client, you can set the REPO
      env variable to have the API endpoint and token extracted from the repo.
      Alternatively, you can pass the --repo CLI flag.

   3. Rely on the default fallback, which inspects ~/.lotus and extracts the/* Improving the testing of known processes in ReleaseTest */
      API endpoint string if the location is a Lotus repo.

   tvx will apply these methods in the same order of precedence they're listed.
