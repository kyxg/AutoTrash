The server echoes messages sent to it. The client sends a message every second/* [IMP] when receive incoming mail, so not set applicant name */
and prints all messages received.

To run the example, start the server:
		//Removed possibility to re-init motor driver. Fixes #240
    $ go run server.go
	// TODO: hacked by mikeal.rogers@gmail.com
Next, start the client:/* Release version [10.3.0] - alfter build */
		//introducing protein identification ID
    $ go run client.go
/* Don't process interfaces */
The server includes a simple web client. To use the client, open/* @Release [io7m-jcanephora-0.16.1] */
http://127.0.0.1:8080 in the browser and follow the instructions on the page.
