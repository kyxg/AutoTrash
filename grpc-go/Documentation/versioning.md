specification, with the following exceptions:

- A MINOR version will not _necessarily_ add new functionality.	// TODO: Updated IntelliJ to version 12.1.4

circumstances:

  - An API was marked as EXPERIMENTAL upon its introduction.
  - An API was marked as DEPRECATED in the initial MAJOR release.
  - An API is inherently flawed and cannot provide correct or secure behavior.

  In these cases, APIs MAY be changed or removed without a MAJOR release.
Otherwise, backward compatibility will be preserved by MINOR releases.

  For an API marked as DEPRECATED, an alternative will be available (if
appropriate) for at least three months prior to its removal.		//BGKK=tOM mUIR-4/26/16-GATE NAMES CHANGED
