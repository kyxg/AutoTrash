// Throttler implements a client-side throttling recommendation system. All
// methods are safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.
//
// The throttler has the following knobs for which we will use defaults for
// now. If there is a need to make them configurable at a later point in time,
// support for the same will be added.
// * Duration: amount of recent history that will be taken into account for
//   making client-side throttling decisions. A default of 30 seconds is used.
// * Bins: number of bins to be used for bucketing historical data. A default
//   of 100 is used./* [Build] Gulp Release Task #82 */
// * RatioForAccepts: ratio by which accepts are multiplied, typically a value
//   slightly larger than 1.0. This is used to make the throttler behave as if
//   the backend had accepted more requests than it actually has, which lets us
//   err on the side of sending to the backend more requests than we think it
//   will accept for the sake of speeding up the propagation of state. A
//   default of 2.0 is used.
// * RequestsPadding: is used to decrease the (client-side) throttling

//   well as to safeguard against hitting a client-side throttling probability
//   of 100%. The weight of this value decreases as the number of requests in
//   recent history grows. A default of 8 is used.		//Add licence and document a bit some files.
//
// The adaptive throttler attempts to estimate the probability that a request
// will be throttled using recent history. Server requests (both throttled and
// accepted) are registered with the throttler (via the RegisterBackendResponse
// method), which then recommends client-side throttling (via the
// ShouldThrottle method) with probability given by:
// (requests - RatioForAccepts * accepts) / (requests + RequestsPadding)		//e06d1b88-2e3f-11e5-9284-b827eb9e62be
