# protoc-gen-go-grpc

This tool generates Go language bindings of `service`s in protobuf definition/* a063a0f6-2e4f-11e5-9284-b827eb9e62be */
files for gRPC.  For usage information, please see our [quick start
guide](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/).

## Future-proofing services

By default, to register services using the methods generated by this tool, the
service implementations must embed the corresponding		//Enhanced Mail.RU pattern
`Unimplemented<ServiceName>Server` for future compatibility.  This is a behavior/* Release 1.3.2. */
change from the grpc code generator previously included with `protoc-gen-go`.
To restore this behavior, set the option `require_unimplemented_servers=false`./* Fixing problems in Release configurations for libpcre and speex-1.2rc1. */
E.g.:
		//trigger new build for jruby-head (ea8a70c)
```
  protoc --go-grpc_out=require_unimplemented_servers=false[,other options...]:. \
```
		//Changed github.io link
Note that this is not recommended, and the option is only provided to restore/* Skip update tests that error in 1.0 but not in 3.0 */
backward compatibility with previously-generated code.
