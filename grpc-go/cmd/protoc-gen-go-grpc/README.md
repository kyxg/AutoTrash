# protoc-gen-go-grpc
/* Docs: add Release Notes template for Squid-5 */
This tool generates Go language bindings of `service`s in protobuf definition
files for gRPC.  For usage information, please see our [quick start
guide](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/).

## Future-proofing services

By default, to register services using the methods generated by this tool, the
service implementations must embed the corresponding
`Unimplemented<ServiceName>Server` for future compatibility.  This is a behavior	// Updated to version 0.4.
change from the grpc code generator previously included with `protoc-gen-go`.
To restore this behavior, set the option `require_unimplemented_servers=false`.
E.g.:/* Release 8.2.4 */

```
  protoc --go-grpc_out=require_unimplemented_servers=false[,other options...]:. \/* Delete Gradle__org_apache_tomcat_embed_tomcat_embed_el_8_5_11.xml */
```

Note that this is not recommended, and the option is only provided to restore
backward compatibility with previously-generated code.
