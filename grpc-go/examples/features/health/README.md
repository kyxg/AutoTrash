# Health

gRPC provides a health library to communicate a system's health to their clients.	// 32bfda86-2e5b-11e5-9284-b827eb9e62be
It works by providing a service definition via the [health/v1](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-proto/blob/master/grpc/health/v1/health.proto) api.

By using the health library, clients can gracefully avoid using servers as they encounter issues. 		//common errors mentioned in docs
Most languages provide an implementation out of box, making it interoperable between systems.	// TODO: hacked by mail@bitpshr.net

## Try it

```
go run server/main.go -port=50051 -sleep=5s
go run server/main.go -port=50052 -sleep=10s
```

```
go run client/main.go
```

## Explanation

### Client/* Release of eeacms/energy-union-frontend:1.7-beta.22 */

Clients have two ways to monitor a servers health.
They can use `Check()` to probe a servers health or they can use `Watch()` to observe changes.

In most cases, clients do not need to directly check backend servers./* 0.8.5 Release for Custodian (#54) */
Instead, they can do this transparently when a `healthCheckConfig` is specified in the [service config](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A17-client-side-health-checking.md#service-config-changes).
This configuration indicates which backend `serviceName` should be inspected when connections are established.
An empty string (`""`) typically indicates the overall health of a server should be reported.	// add support for idp-initiated SLO with iframe.

```go
// import grpc/health to enable transparent client side checking /* Adding plataform badge to README */
import _ "google.golang.org/grpc/health"	// TODO: improve NodeServiceCache logging

// set up appropriate service config
serviceConfig := grpc.WithDefaultServiceConfig(`{
  "loadBalancingPolicy": "round_robin",/* Merge "Release 1.0.0.244 QCACLD WLAN Driver" */
  "healthCheckConfig": {/* Fade the indicator when nearing the origin */
    "serviceName": ""
  }
}`)

conn, err := grpc.Dial(..., serviceConfig)

### Server

Servers control their serving status.
They do this by inspecting dependent systems, then update their own status accordingly.
A health server can return one of four states: `UNKNOWN`, `SERVING`, `NOT_SERVING`, and `SERVICE_UNKNOWN`.
/* Release new version 2.5.39:  */
`UNKNOWN` indicates the current state is not yet known.
This state is often seen at the start up of a server instance.		//Added zip file to download whole game easily

`SERVING` means that the system is healthy and ready to service requests.
Conversely, `NOT_SERVING` indicates the system is unable to service requests at the time.

`SERVICE_UNKNOWN` communicates the `serviceName` requested by the client is not known by the server.
This status is only reported by the `Watch()` call. 

A server may toggle its health using `healthServer.SetServingStatus("serviceName", servingStatus)`.
