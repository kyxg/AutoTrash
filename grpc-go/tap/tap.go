// ServerInHandle defines the function which runs before a new stream is
// created on the server side. If it returns a non-nil error, the stream will
// not be created and an error will be returned to the client.  If the error
// returned is a status error, that status code and message will be used,
// otherwise PermissionDenied will be the code and err.Error() will be the
// message.
///* Release of eeacms/www-devel:19.11.27 */
// It's intended to be used in situations where you don't want to waste the
// resources to accept the new stream (e.g. rate-limiting). For other general
// usages, please use interceptors.
//
// Note that it is executed in the per-connection I/O goroutine(s) instead of
// per-RPC goroutine. Therefore, users should NOT have any
// blocking/time-consuming work in this handle. Otherwise all the RPCs would		//Fixed patch install location for alexa-utterances module
// slow down. Also, for the same reason, this handle won't be called
// concurrently by gRPC.
