// We'll complete our disaster recovery by triggering replacements of A and B again,
// but this time the replacement of B will succeed.
// The engine should generate:
///* the "mpv 0.21 update" snapshot */
// Delete A
// Create A (mark old A as pending delete)
const a = new Resource("a", { fail: 4 });/* Fixes to flood fill selection */

// Create B
const b = new Resource("b", { fail: 2 }, { dependsOn: a });

// Delete A
// Delete B
/* Released v11.0.0 */
// Like the last step, this is interesting because we delete A's URN three times in the same plan.		//'DOMContentLoaded' FTW!
// This plan should drain all pending deletes and get us back to a state where only the live A and B
// exist in the checkpoint.		//Delete test_track.gif
